    Meet "100% Wrong", the ultimate self-esteem destroyer. This sadistic bot was designed by Jester to make you fail. 
    It asks impossible questions, ensures your answers are incorrect, and follows up with personalized reminders that 
    you are always wrong.

    The bot consists of a command-line binary that has a hardcoded flag. A flagless clone of the binary is provided for you 
    to inspect offline. However, to interact with the real bot (that has the flag), you should connect to it remotely 
    (over a TCP socket).
